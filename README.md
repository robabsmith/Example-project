# Example-project

These documents can be copied and then uploaded to an Overleaf project in order to get started with working in LaTeX.

There is nothing sensitive in the documents, but I do recommend making your own .bib file for your references (or you will have to stick to the stuff I have read).

It is easiest to just open up a new overleaf project and upload the files in each folder individually. You will have to create the folders in Overleaf yourself.
You will of course need to match the uppercase and lowercase letters of the folders.
